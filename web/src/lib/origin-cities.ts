/**
 * Origin-city landing pages — "Kashmir tour packages from {city}".
 *
 * WHY THESE EXIST
 * ---------------
 * The all-time Google Ads search-terms report (54,458 unique queries) shows
 * the "package from {city}" pattern is the single highest-converting template
 * we have: 7.29% CTR against a 2.11% account average, and 65 conversions.
 * Every city below is backed by real query volume from that report.
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULE FOR THIS FILE
 * ------------------------------
 * `flight` and `train` are deliberately nullable and ship as `null`.
 * Fares move weekly; they are quoted live rather than fabricated statically.
