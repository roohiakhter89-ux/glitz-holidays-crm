  {
    q: 'How do I book a trip with Glitz Holidays?',
    a: 'Send an enquiry or WhatsApp us with your dates, group size and rough plan. We come back with a custom itinerary and quote within a few hours. Once you are happy, a booking advance confirms your hotels and vehicles, and the balance is due before arrival.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much advance do you need to confirm a booking?',
    a: 'Typically 25% of the package value to confirm hotels and vehicles, with the balance before arrival. For peak-season dates or where a hotel demands full prepayment, we tell you upfront rather than after you have committed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
    a: 'Bank transfer (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS) and UPI. We issue a GST invoice for every booking. We do not ask for payment to a personal account — if anyone claiming to be us does, stop and call our office number.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is your cancellation policy?',
    a: 'It varies by season and by what the hotels have already charged us. As a rule, more than 30 days out you recover most of the advance; inside 15 days, hotel and transport commitments are largely non-refundable. The exact terms are written into every quote before you pay anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are your prices per person or for the whole group?',
    a: 'All listed prices are per person on twin-sharing, GST included. Single occupancy, triple rooms, extra beds and children pricing are quoted separately based on your actual group.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do prices change with season?',
    a: 'Yes, substantially. Peak windows — May–June, Christmas–New Year, Navratri for Vaishno Devi — can run 30–50% above shoulder season for the identical itinerary. The starting prices on this site reflect shoulder season.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you handle flights?',
    a: 'No. We do not book airfare, because you will almost always find a better fare yourself and we would just be adding a margin. We do advise on which airports to fly into and out of so your itinerary is not wasting a day backtracking.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you customise a package?',
    a: 'Every package on this site is a starting point. Add nights, change hotel category, start from a different city, travel with fifteen people instead of two — tell us what changes and we rebuild the itinerary and the quote.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you work with travel agents and B2B partners?',
    a: 'Yes. We handle ground operations for agencies across India as a DMC. Contact us directly for partner rates and terms.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What if something goes wrong during the trip?',
    a: 'You have one named coordinator on WhatsApp for the whole trip, and our office number reaches a person, not a queue. Hotels get changed, routes get rerouted, and roads get closed — what matters is how fast someone picks up.',
  },
